## Introduction

Welcome to my submission for Project 2, focusing on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Inferential Statistics as part of the Vanguard digital experiment evaluation. This project involved analyzing client data to determine the effectiveness of a new user interface (UI) implemented at Vanguard, a leading investment management company. 

The primary objective was to assess whether the new UI, designed to enhance user experience through intuitive navigation and timely prompts, led to increased process completion rates among clients.

## Project Overview

### Context

As a newly employed data analyst in the Customer Experience (CX) team at Vanguard, I was tasked with evaluating the results of a digital experiment conducted between March 15, 2017, and June 20, 2017. The experiment involved a control group using Vanguard's traditional online process and a test group experiencing the revamped digital interface.

### Datasets Used

1. **Client Profiles (df_final_demo)**: Contains demographic information such as age, gender, and account details of clients.
2. **Digital Footprints (df_final_web_data)**: A detailed log of client interactions on the Vanguard platform, split into two parts for comprehensive analysis.
3. **Experiment Roster (df_final_experiment_clients)**: A list indicating which clients participated in the experiment.

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning and EDA

- Conducted data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency across the datasets.
- Performed exploratory data analysis to understand client demographics, behavior patterns, and engagement metrics.

### Key Insights from EDA

- The majority of clients fall within the 40 to 60 age range, suggesting a significant target demographic for Vanguard's marketing strategies.
- Clients with higher account balances were more likely to complete the process, indicating a potential opportunity for targeted services.
- The analysis of user interactions revealed critical areas for improving the user experience, especially for the 40-70 age group.

### Performance Metrics

To evaluate the effectiveness of the new UI, I established several key performance indicators (KPIs):

- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of clients completing the process.
- **Drop-out Rate**: Percentage of clients exiting at each step of the process.
- **Time Spent per Step**: Duration clients spent at each stage, helping identify potential friction points.

### Hypothesis Testing

I performed hypothesis testing to determine the statistical significance of the changes observed between the control and test groups. Key hypotheses included:

1. **Completion Rate Difference**: Analyzed whether the new UI increased the completion rate compared to the traditional process.
2. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Assessed the completion rate in relation to client engagement costs.

## Findings

### Performance Evaluation

- The control group exhibited a completion rate of 56%, while the test group had a rate of 51%, indicating a need for further investigation into the test group's drop-out behavior.
- Drop-out rates were highest at critical steps, suggesting that focusing on these areas could enhance overall completion rates.
- The average time spent at various steps highlighted specific stages where clients experienced delays, pointing to potential usability issues.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend:

- Refining the user interface further, particularly at drop-off points, to streamline the process and encourage completion.
- Tailoring marketing efforts to the 40-60 age demographic, leveraging insights on account balances and client behavior.
- Continuously monitoring and testing new UI features to foster improved user experiences and client satisfaction.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into client behavior and preferences at Vanguard. The findings not only evaluate the recent digital changes but also lay the groundwork for future enhancements. By utilizing a data-driven approach, Vanguard can continue to improve its digital experience and better serve its clients.

## Deliverables

- A complete analysis of the A/B testing results.
- Visualizations created using Tableau to illustrate key findings.
- Jupyter notebooks documenting the code and calculations performed during the analysis.
- A link to the final presentation summarizing the project and results.

Thank you for reviewing my project submission. I welcome any feedback and look forward to future enhancements based on these findings!
